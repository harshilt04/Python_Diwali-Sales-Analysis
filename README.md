# Python_Diwali-Sales-Analysis
With the help of 𝐉𝐮𝐩𝐲𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤, I've dived into the world of data analysis and visualization. Here's a quick overview:

𝟏. 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 : Installed essential libraries like 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐲, 𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐬, 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐛, and 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐧 for data handling and visualization.

𝟐. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 : Removed null values and performed data manipulation to prepare the dataset for analysis.

𝟑. 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 : Utilized 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐧, 𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐛 for data visualization and the 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩𝐛𝐲 function for insights. I created graphs to analyze sales trends across different product categories, states, occupations, genders, and age groups.

The end result revealed that married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, healthcare, and aviation industries, are more likely to buy products from the food, clothing, and electronics categories.

The project's goal is to improve sales by identifying the most selling products (food, clothes, and electronics) to plan inventory and meet customer demands effectively
